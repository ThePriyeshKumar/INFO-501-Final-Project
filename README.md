# How to use the application 
This section provides a step-by-step guide on how to set up and use the machine learning application for predicting KTAS scores.

# Step 1: Cloning the Repository
Firstly, clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine. Open your command line interface and run the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/ThePriyeshKumar/INFO-501-Final-Project.git `

This command will create a copy of the project in your current directory.

# Step 2: Installing Required Libraries
After cloning the repository, you need to install several Python libraries that the project depends on. Navigate to the cloned project directory and execute the following pip commands to install each library:

NumPy: A library for numerical computations in Python.
   `pip install numpy`

Pandas: Essential for data manipulation and analysis.
   `pip install pandas`

Scikit-learn (sklearn): A tool for data mining and data analysis.
   `pip install scikit-learn`

Matplotlib: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
   `pip install matplotlib`

Seaborn: A Python visualization library based on matplotlib, providing a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.
   `pip install seaborn`
   
# Step 3: Running the Notebook
Once all the libraries are installed, locate the `501_Project_Code.ipynb` file in the cloned repository folder. Open this file in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible IDE that supports `.ipynb` files.

Run all the cells in the notebook from top to bottom. Each cell can be run by selecting it and pressing 'Shift + Enter', or by using the run command in your IDE. Ensure that you run the cells in sequence to maintain the flow of data loading, processing, model training, and evaluation.

By following these steps, you will be able to set up and run the application, enabling you to predict KTAS scores using the implemented machine learning models.
